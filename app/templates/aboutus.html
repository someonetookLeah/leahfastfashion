        Hello this is the 'NALI Project' and our Senior Capstone for the Computer Science Academy.
        our project is about fast fashion and we created this website so that you can swap or giveaway clothing that you 
        no longer want to help advocate toward fast fashion.

    <h4>What is Fast Fashion?</h4>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">
    Fast fashion is clothing that is made with cheap materials and cheap labor. It's clothing that is made to be cheap, follow the 
    current trends, and is made to meet consumer demand.  It's severely unethical and not 
    environmentally friendly in any way.

    Hi, I'm Leah Vann, a senior for the Computer Science Academy at Oakland Tech. I chose to do this topic and project because of my
    own personal experiences with fast fashion. I personally buy a lot of clothing but when I learned about what fast fashion was I 
    became more aware of the clothing that I was buying and started becoming more selective with the clothing and brands I buy. After
    doing research I learned about different ways that you can get clothing without buying from fast fashion brands, so that is why we
    created this website.
