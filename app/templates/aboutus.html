            Hello this is the 'NALI Project' and our Senior Capstone for the Computer Science Academy 2022-2023.
            Our project is about fast fashion so we created this website so that you can swap or giveaway clothing that you 
            no longer want so that you can help advocate toward ending fast fashion. We all have differnt experiences with 
            fashion and not everyone is aware of what it is. Fast fashion is very cheap and highly accessible, but we hope
            that with our website, you can help reduce your fast fashion footprint to help the earth, people, and economy!
            Below you can read about what fast fashion is and below that you can learn about the members individually!</p>

    <p style="font-size:20px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">
    Fast fashion is clothing that is made with cheap materials and cheap labor. It's clothing that is made to be cheap, follow the 
    current trends, and is made to meet consumer demand.  It's severely unethical and not 
    environmentally friendly in any way. The industry produces high volumes of clothing, which means that the clothing the consumers
    pay for is made with poor quality. The industry also employs workers from third world countries with low wages, exploiting them 
    and exposing them to dangerous work conditions. The environmental impact on fast fashions consists of its use of non-renewable items, 
    greenhouse gases, and its massive use of water and energy to create clothing.

    Hi, I'm Leah Vann, a senior for the Computer Science Academy at Oakland Tech. I chose to do this topic and project because of my
    own personal experiences with fast fashion. I personally buy a lot of clothing but when I learned about what fast fashion was I 
    became more aware of the clothing that I was buying and started becoming more selective with the clothing and brands I buy. After
    doing research I learned about different ways that you can get clothing without buying from fast fashion brands, so that is why we
    created this website.

    My name is Aileen and I'm a senior at Oakland Tech in the Computer Academy. I've always been passionate about finding ways to reduce 
    any of my environmental harmful foot prints in my everyday life, in this project, I specifically look at the environmental impacts that 
    fast fashion has. When the issue of fast fashion came to my attention, I knew I wanted to pursue it further for my Capstone project. 
    In my personal life, I make an effort to thrift instead of buying new clothes because 
    of this project. In my spare time, I like to be outdoors.

    I'm Natalie, a senior in the CS Academy at Oakland Tech and for this project I look at the financial aspect of this topic. Ever since this 
    issue was made aware to me, I started making efforts to buy second hand instead of new clothes to also save money! When I'm not working on 
    this project, I like to play video games, play tetris, read comics, and go shopping.
